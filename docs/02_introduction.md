Among other uses this workflow could determine the success of a molecular cloning experiment and determine whether one DNA sequence has been correctly inserted into another as an experimentalist was expecting.

In brief, this workflow will perform the following:

+ *De novo* assembly of plasmids.
+ Annotation of the full assembly.
+ Provide a per base quality score of the plasmid assembly.
+ Locate an insert sequence in a plasmid using provided primers.
+ Multiple sequence alignment between insert sequences from different samples.
+ Create an assembly dot plot showing repetitive regions in the created assemblies. 
+ Comparison between an insert reference and the assembled insert.
